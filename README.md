**This plugin is under development. Do not expect anything to be working.**

- if you use [Can I Mog It?](https://mods.curse.com/addons/wow/can-i-mog-it), transmog information will be added to the tooltip too
Icons

- blue skulls = loot needed

 

**If you find errors, false information or missing loot, please leave me a comment.**

**Enjoy!**
